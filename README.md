# solana-dev-env

Setting up a Solana development environment isn't particularly straightforward, and maintaining it over time isn't something I particularly want to do. I'd far rather have an dev environment that doesn't require me spending a ton of time to keep it running

# gitpod environment

Opening this repo inside gitpod will trigger the build of a Solana dev/test environment

Note that you'll need to run `. ~/.profile` after the environment has been built, to get the `solana` CLI onto the path
